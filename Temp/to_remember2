All else being equal, rising interest rates would reduce reinvestment risk since income from portfolio can be reinvested at rates higher than currently available. 
Given the current asset/liability structure, as interest rates increase the value of the assets will decline by less than the value of the liability.
She use a small smaple of obs of below-average inerest rates to forecast above-average interest rates, thus expecting a reversion to the mean in the short run, 
rather than the long run. This is gambler's fallacy.
